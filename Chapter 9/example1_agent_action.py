Simplified Agent Initialization in LangChain v0.2 (H3)
Here is an illustrative example that showcases the simplified Agent initialization in v0.2:

from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Load the necessary tools
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))

# Initialize the Agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Run the Agent with a query
query = "What is the capital of France? What is the population of that city?"
response = agent.run(query)
print(response)
As you can see, the initialize_agent function takes care of selecting the appropriate Agent type based on the provided tools and language model, making the initialization process more intuitive and straightforward.
